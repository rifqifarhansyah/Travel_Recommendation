Some specific places to consider visiting include Borobudur, the world's largest Buddhist monument, and nearby Prambanan, a significant Hindu monument. Indonesia is also known for its exceptional scuba diving spots, such as Bunaken, Wakatobi, Alor Archipelago, and Raja Ampat. Additionally, Bali is a popular tourist destination, though its diving may be less impressive than other locations. However, due to the country's size and geography, transportation and logistics can be challenging, and infrastructure issues persist. Nonetheless, with over 6,000 inhabited islands, there is no shortage of destinations to explore in this exotic and culturally rich nation.\n"
